- 9b1e118: Derive the answer key, partial credit, item weight and choice layout from the QTI source
  instead of dropping them.

  Five conversion defects, each of which produced a PIE item that renders correctly and is
  therefore silently wrong. They were found by comparing `to-pie` against a batch loader
  that has been run over far more real publisher content than our conversion path has.

  **The answer key can live in `mapping`, and nine transformers did not look there.**
  `mapEntry` was consulted only in `drag-in-the-blank`, `ebsr` and `match-list`. This is
  plain QTI, not a vendor quirk: an item scored by the `map_response` template need not
  declare a `correctResponse` at all. Such an item converted with an _empty answer key_ —
  it rendered, but was unscorable and showed reviewers no key. A new
  `utils/response-scoring.ts` now supplies the fallback to `multiple-choice`,
  `inline-dropdown`, `placement-ordering`, `select-text`, `match`, `hotspot`,
  `explicit-constructed-response`, `image-cloze-association` and
  `associate-to-categorize`.

  Two rules keep the fallback safe and both are load-bearing:

  - **`correctResponse` always wins.** The mapping is read only when the declared key
    produced nothing, so a declared key is never overwritten.
  - **Only a strictly positive `mappedValue` marks a key correct.** Real Savvas content
    ships `<mapping defaultValue="-0" lowerBound="0" upperBound="0">` with _every_
    `mapEntry` at `mappedValue="0"` while the real key sits in `correctResponse`. An
    unsigned reading of those marks every listed choice correct. `drag-in-the-blank` only
    skipped negatives, so it admitted the zero-scoring case; `match-list` had no sign check
    at all.

  **`partialScoring` and item weight are now derived, not asked for.** `partialScoring` was
  a caller-supplied option that no caller in `registry/`, `plugin.ts`,
  `package-transformer.ts` or `source-profile-runtime.ts` ever set, so every converted item
  was all-or-nothing even when its source declared graded credit. `mapping/@upperBound` was
  read nowhere. A mapping's presence now implies partial scoring, and the weight resolves
  from `mapping/@upperBound`, then the `MAXSCORE` outcome declaration, then the summed
  positive `mapEntry` values, landing on `searchMetaData.maxScore`. The option remains as an
  explicit override.

  `@upperBound` is validated rather than handed to `Number()`. Observed values in the
  Region 10 / TEKSbank delivery include `"Max:3"` (`Number()` → `NaN`), `"0"` (parses, but
  is not a usable weight) and `"2 "` (must still parse as 2). Non-numeric and non-positive
  values are rejected and the next fallback is used.

  **Choice cardinality no longer trusts `maxChoices` alone.** It was
  `maxChoices === 1 ? 'radio' : 'checkbox'` with the attribute defaulted to `1` when
  absent, so a multi-answer item with a missing or wrong `maxChoices` became a single-select
  radio group that could not express its own answer key. `multiple-choice` and each `ebsr`
  part now switch to checkbox when more than one correct answer was found, independently of
  `maxChoices`. The `MC`/`MCA` `itemType` follows the resulting mode rather than repeating
  the same assumption. Cardinality is derived _after_ the answer key so a mapping-derived
  multi-answer key also triggers it.

  **`choiceInteraction/@orientation` is carried into the PIE choice layout.** It was read
  for `orderInteraction` and `sliderInteraction` but not `choiceInteraction`, so authored
  layout was silently dropped. `horizontal` and `vertical` pass through to `choicesLayout`;
  `grid` and `stacked` have no PIE equivalent and collapse onto a two-column grid
  (`choicesLayout: 'grid'`, `gridColumns: 2`). An absent orientation emits nothing, leaving
  the element's own default rather than pinning it to a guess. `pie-to-qti2` carries
  `choicesLayout` back out to `orientation` so the round trip is symmetric.

  **The hotspot player no longer guesses an image size.** `HotspotInteraction.svelte` fell
  back to `viewBox="0 0 800 600"` when the image's intrinsic dimensions were unknown.
  `hotspotChoice` coords are in the source image's pixel space, so that fallback does not
  degrade gracefully — it misplaces _every_ region, which reads as a content defect rather
  than the missing metadata it is. The overlay is now gated on known dimensions and an
  explanatory diagnostic is rendered instead (new
  `interactions.hotspot.unknownImageDimensions` message). The `to-pie` hotspot transform
  already failed loudly here; the player now agrees with it.

  27 conformance fixtures were added under
  `packages/to-pie/tests/fixtures/conversion-fidelity/` covering a mapping-only key per
  affected interaction type, mixed `mappedValue` signs, the all-zero-mapping precedence
  case, all three weight fallbacks plus both malformed `@upperBound` forms, both broken
  cardinality shapes, and every `orientation` value. The mapping-only shapes are
  synthesized: across 89,836 TEKSbank items every mapping-bearing response also declares a
  `correctResponse`, so no real item exercises the fallback.

### Patch Changes

- 5a4e39a: Normalize `repository.url` to the `git+https://` form.

  npm was rewriting this field at publish time and warning about it:

  ```
  npm warn publish "repository.url" was normalized to "git+https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-qti.git"
  ```

  Beyond silencing that warning, npm requires `repository.url` to match the GitHub
  repository exactly when generating provenance attestations, so this is a prerequisite
  for moving publishing to trusted publishing (OIDC). No runtime or API change.
