    <h2>The Industrial Revolution</h2>
    <p>The Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in history. During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, new manufacturing processes transformed largely rural, agrarian societies in Europe and America into industrial and urban ones.</p>
    <p>Goods that had once been painstakingly crafted by hand started to be produced in mass quantities by machines in factories. The boom in productivity and economic growth had profound effects on the structure of society.</p>
    <p>Key innovations included the steam engine, spinning jenny, and power loom. These technological advances led to the growth of cities, changes in labor practices, and new social classes emerging.</p>
