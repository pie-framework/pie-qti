### Patch Changes

- abe0be5: Add package-owned QTI theme tokens and a DaisyUI bridge so host applications can cascade their active theme into QTI players through stable `--pie-qti-*` variables.

  `loadPieQtiPlayerElements()` now also loads the bundled default interaction web components, giving browser hosts a single stable loader for the default player runtime.

  `@pie-qti/web-component-loaders/default-runtime.css` now exposes the default browser runtime CSS, including the DaisyUI theme bridge and QTI shared vocabulary classes.
