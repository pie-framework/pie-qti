# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in PIE-QTI, please **do not** open a public issue.

Instead, report it privately using one of the following options:

- Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting (Security Advisories) for this repository.
- If private reporting is not available, contact the maintainers directly and provide:
  - A clear description of the issue and impact
  - Steps to reproduce (or a proof-of-concept)
  - Affected versions/branches, if known

We will acknowledge receipt, investigate, and coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are provided for the **default branch** and recent releases where feasible.
